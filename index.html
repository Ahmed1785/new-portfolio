    <img class="headshot" src="public/assets/headshot.jpg">
    <p class="sub">I'm an IT Analyst turned Software Engineer. With over 4 years working in the IT field, In 2017,
      after my wife gave birth
      to our first baby boy, I decided I wanted to do a career change. I attended a coding bootcamp where I learned Web
      Development
      using technologies such as HTML, CSS, Javascript, ASP.NET, and a few other languages. I started building full
      stack
      CRUD applications and developed a passion for coding. My experience as a Software Development Engineer includes a
      3
      month internship with a Startup called SilverObject LLC, where we were working on building a cloud SaaS
      application.
      To keep up with my skills, I also program on the side and strive to have a deep understanding of the technologies
      I'm
      familiar with. My educational background includes a BS in Information Technology at Central Washington
      University.
      As a mentioned above, I also attended Coding Dojo where I received a certificate of completion for the Web
      Development
      program.
